Sound Texture Toolbox (STTB)
===


Simple Demo
---
For a quick demo run the following scripts.

1. Run `analyze_sound_texture.m` to extract sound texture statistics.
2. Run `plot_stats_loaded.m` to visualize the statistics.
3. Run `synthesize_sound_texture.m` to synthesize a sample from the extracted statistics. This step will take a few minutes.


Explicit Demo
---
The files with the `_explicit` postfix are implmentations that call the underlying functions and shows the full process of the sound texture analysis and synthesis.

1. Run `analyze_sound_texture_explicit.m` to extract sound texture statistics.
2. Run `synthesize_sound_texture_explicit.m` to synthesize a sample from the extracted statistics. This step will take a few minutes.
